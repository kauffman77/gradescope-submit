#+title: Gradescope Submit Script Development Notes

* TODO Items
- Add handling for failure to submit due to deadline passing;
  currently reports submission successful in this case 
- Test on some remote systems like UMD's GRACE cluster
  - Naturally found that Grace doens't have requests installed and
    will need to find a work-around
  - Installing requests via
    - ~module load python~
    - ~pip install requests --user~ 
    leads to a library problem with libssl on grace
  - Options are to try to
    - ditch the dependency on ~requests~
    - find an install solution on GRACE
    - punt and wait to see what changes I can make to the server setup
      for UMD - get a sane server installed

- Check that the behavior on multiple "tests" is correct such as 216's
  projects with multiple problems


* Completed

* Submit success / JSON API
- looking at checking for valid submissions
- If doing submit and using JSON interface get easy feedback
#+BEGIN_SRC pyton
...
  url = f"{GRADESCOPE_URL}/courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assign_id}/submissions"
  headers = {'Accept': 'application/json, text/javascript'}
  response = session.post(url, data=submit_data, files=submit_files, headers=headers)
...
# when submission is open
(Pdb) print(response.text)
{"success":true,"url":"/courses/618117/assignments/6326806/submissions/337026019"}

# when submission is closed
(Pdb) print(response.text)
{"success":false,"url":"/courses/618117"}
#+END_SRC

- Checked and for other sites, it doesn't look like the JSON interface
  is viable as it does not provide the ~authenticity_token~ that is
  needed for submission
#+BEGIN_SRC python
...
  url = f"{GRADESCOPE_URL}/courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assign_id}"
...
(Pdb) headers = {'Accept': 'application/json, text/javascript'}
(Pdb) response = session.get(url, headers=headers)
(Pdb) print(response.text)
{"status":"processed","results":{"score":null,"tests":[{"name":"Lab Tests","score":1.0,"number":null,"output":"gcc -Wall -Wno-comment -Werror -g  -o hello_c hello_c.c\n./testy test_lab01.org\n===============================\n== test_lab01.org : Lab01 Tests\n== Running 2 / 2 tests\n1) QUIZ: QUESTIONS.txt  : ok\n2) CODE: hello_c output : ok\n===============================\nRESULTS: 1.00 / 1.00 points \n","status":null,"max_score":1.0,"name_format":null,"output_format":null}],"output":null,"output_format":null,"test_name_format":null,"stdout_visibility":"visible","test_output_format":null,"stdout":"Changing to working directory /autograder/submission/solution-lab01-216\nCleaning old test files\nrm -f hello_c  *.o\nrm -rf test-results\nCopying testing files\nRunning tests as user student\nRunning code specific to assignment, results in ag-results/*.json\nMerging results of tests from ag-results/\nCopying test results to Gradescope\nDone","stdout_shown_to_students":true,"error_code":""}}
# no authenticity token with JSON, can't file new submission
#+END_SRC

Adding checks for successful / failed submission

* Checking Autograder Results
- GET request to a certain site like:
  https://www.gradescope.com/courses/618117/assignments/6326806/submissions/336666835
- Final number might be a redirect from the ~submissions~ script
- returns ~{"status":"autograder_task_started"}~ when not complete

Was able to incorporate this into a loop that repeatedly looks for the
'processed status' and parses test results after that.


* Initial Dev
- Poking around at this
- Mileage out of using Chrome Devtools, observing the network logs,
  use "Preserve Log" option as page changes
- the "submissions" script seems to be the main vehicle to upload
  stuff
  - POST request
  - Content size reflects what is being uploaded
- Javascript codebase is tough to parse as it looks like it has been
  generated from compiling (e.g. typescript)
- Significant progress, working curl prototypes here:
  file:/home/kauffman/Dropbox/projects/gradescope-submit/
- Need a way to extract cookies for the session
  - firefox might provide this but it is tricky due to locking of the
    database; may not be able to access it while browser is running
    and initial foray indicated the cookies I need aren't present
  - chrome encrypts their cookies complicating things
  - yt-dlp has python code to allow for decoding cookies
- For web debugging, find that Chrome Dev Tools are inferior for some
  things to Firefox
  - FF shows the actual content of form data that is submitted in a
    POST and allows copies to be made of at least portions of the data
    formatted
  - For this see the Network tab in Dev Tools, find a POST XHR
    communication (filter via ~method:POST~), select it and find the
    "Reply" section
  - Chrome shows similar information EXCEPT it does not show the body
    of the data (no "Reply" section); this is a known limitation which
    appears to be intentional as displaying that info would take up a
    lot of space
- Handling browser keys
  - https://n8henrie.com/2013/11/use-chromes-cookies-for-easier-downloading-with-python-requests/
    - Cited by a few other sites as a good small example
    - Shows the use of Sqlite and Crypto modules in python but at
      least Crypto looks like
    - Works on Chrome for Linux/OSX
  - https://pypi.org/project/browsercookie/ and
    https://github.com/richardpenman/browsercookie
    - 3rd party library for dealing with cookies from browsers
    - indicates compat with a few of platforms/browsers (no safari)
    - Reasonably maintained (recent contribs)
    - LGPL, single source file - easy to port over
    - Unfortunately has a bunch of dependencies; from setup.py:
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
          install_requires=['cryptography', 'keyring', 'lz4',
                            'pywin32; sys_platform == "win32"'],
      #+END_SRC
    - cryptography,keyring,lz4,pywin32 are all external libraries
- Monitoring cookie transfers starting at
  https://www.gradescope.com/login which responds with these cookies
  - signed_token :: returned on login, seems to be the login
    credential which is needed to access; returned after
    authenticating on the ~login~ page
  - remember_me :: returned on login, purpose unclear, was not needed
    for the submit I did earlier
  - _gradescope_session :: cookie changes each time with a
    request/response and is meant to chain: use a valid session cookie
    in a request, a new cookie will be sent in the response that
    allows the session to continue. From my experience futzing with
    curl, it does not seem that one must maintain this chain; I used a
    valid previous session cookie repeatedly to submit and it worked fine
  email and password are transmitted in plain text via a form
  submission and POST there
- POST on https://www.gradescope.com/login was fairy straight-forward;
  form data was
  #+BEGIN_SRC text
  utf8	"✓"
  authenticity_token	"rvl4ry76o26F9YcSYaaIQj49xAxvluWnsAo2yhgIMu7Ef6WN0TDXX/xNpRW/HpH0J0goPk/ge0+d8mr+968/9Q=="
  session[email]	"emailaddr@gmail.com"
  session[password]	"abc123456"
  session[remember_me]	"0"
  commit	"Log+In"
  session[remember_me_sso]	"0"
  #+END_SRC
  Troubling is the authenticity token that is needed; not sure where
  this comes from and will need to figure it out
- *authenticity_token* comes up on GET to
  https://www.gradescope.com/account as hidden form inputs, at least a
  couple of these are in the form which seems to be immediately
  accessed after the POST to login
  - value is traced to the specific assignment page which is like
    https://www.gradescope.com/courses/618117/assignments/5522418/
  - On that page is a matching meta element in the <head> that is
    #+BEGIN_SRC html
    <meta name="csrf-token" content="gi/QWiHknyY44oFrsqA/1V3X3Jhx3ckOhkDtcfgTZK0yaiCs/6Eq+w8NpaIg0zYBHGCY/Yb54ATYtFXoT1JQBQ==" />
    #+END_SRC
  - The content is the value that is used for the submissions form as
    the authenticity_token, likely as a measure to prevent spamming
  - Have checked and on refreshing the page, this token changes so it
    is a per page visit token BUT appears to be usable for some time
    after the first issue as I used the same token multiple times in
    submitting using curl
  - TIP: in Firefox dev tools, just do a Ctl-Shift-F search for the
    content value like ~QWiHkny~ in the network panel and all text
    will be scanned for the item of interest and show past HTML pages,
    form contents etc. that contain it, very handy for tracing
    communication

* Possibilities for browser cookies / credentials
1. Students log in with the browser then use techniques to obtain the
   keys/cookies from the browser info
   - Don't need to reverse engineer the entire protocol for the site,
     just extract the needed cookies / keys from the browser cache
   - Seems that 3rd party libraries will be needed to get browser
     cookies and such
   - Not clear that one would be able to leverage just the browser
     cookies here due to the protocol gradescope has which involves
     obtaining multiple pieces of information in order to submit; need
     data from login and submission page

2. Direct authentication using python to contact server, get
   credentials, submit, possibly cache cookies / keys for later use 
   - More work as must engineer the whole protocol of login /
     submission but more control; will need a detailed analysis of the
     source of the authenticity_token / signed_token /
     _gradescope_session data that comes from the site
   - Will work on either local or remote, same machine as where
     submission is going
   - Can use 3rd party libraries on machines where I can install
     things like Grace
   - Python has built-in libraries for http access, dealing somewhat
     with cookies from communication, reading password information in,
     etc. so a good start on this
   - Unclear whether 3rd party libraries will be needed for
     communication and processing; won't need to worry about the
     encryption of cookies / keys

#2 starts to seem much more plausible compared to the pain of 1; a
single Gradescope password prompt is all that is needed to cache
submits for a time, can cache in a local or global file, can retry
communications if it seems that cached items are not working anymore

* Rough protocol
- login :: POST https://www.gradescope.com/login
  - accepts email / password as POST form data
  - responds with cookies, most important is ~signed_token~ which
    gives access to the site; may also wish to retain a
    ~_gradescope_session~ cookie as this seems like it is needed for
    the submissions
- (optional) account :: GET https://www.gradescope.com/account
  - uses ~signed_token~ for access
  - html contains some ~authenticity_token~ forms but none of these
    seem to matter
  - overall this page does not seem to have anything useful so may
    just skip it
- assignment :: GET https://www.gradescope.com/courses/618117/assignments/5522418/
  - Assignment page 
  - Requires ~signed_token~ in cookies
  - May give a 302 "Found" redirect response with a new URL when
    a submission is already available such as
    https://www.gradescope.com/courses/618117/assignments/5522418/submissions/336394834
  - *check when no assignment is submitted that the below is possible*
  - Contains ~<meta name="csrf-token" content="..." />~ tag with
    ~authenticity_token~ as the value
- submissions :: POST https://www.gradescope.com/courses/618117/assignments/5522418/submissions
  - requires ~signed_token~ cookie
  - Form data that will upload the submission
  - ~Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=...~
  - First part is the upload indicator
  - Second part is the ~authenticity_token~
  - Remaining parts are the files with content type

This protocol relies on the "native" email/password for Gradescope
rather than the school credentials / SSO
- Initiate a password reset with @terpmail.umd.edu address
- Set the password and note it for use with the command line tool

* Python Tech
- requests :: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  - 3rd party package
  - installed on Arch via ~python-requests~, seems to have several
    dependencies like ~python-urllib3~ which ups the complexity
    somewhat, has numerous packages that require it including core
    players like cinnamon, inkscape, etc.
  - Cited in several spots as the [[https://realpython.com/python-requests/]["de facto standard"]]
  - Excellent docs and intro examples that answer the basic questions
    I have
  - Lots of features like cookie handling for sessions, automatic
    encoding for multipart forms, reasonable interface for post / get 
  - seems to handle HTTPS seamlessly in examples, no special args
  - have tried a few examples and it works easily with Gradescope,
    able to see certain items like the cookies / cookiejar
- urllib :: https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html
  - standard library so built in
  - looks somewhat baroque
  - immediately see trouble in that it requires extra steps to work
    with HTTPS but may be able to mitigate this
  - indicates at the top that the requests library is recommended for
    high-level work, not a rousing endorsement...
  - allusions to cookie handling but no examples
- gradescopeapi :: https://pypi.org/project/gradescopeapi/
  - 3rd party package
  - indicates it deals with gradescope stuff, has login, something
    about file upload
  - uses the requests library including a Session object
  - worthy of study to see how this works and if some things can be
    lifted from it or simply use this system
  - Seems to solve the same problems I need to address: uses
    bs4.BeautifulSoup to parts HTML fto find the ~csrf-token~ meta tag
    and insert its contents in the form
  - Likely can lift considerable code from this package


Seems like requests library is the right for the initial foray so will
bark up that tree first

* <2025-06-10 Tue>: working prototype 
Got a working prototype of a script together for this in
file:prototyping/gradescope-submit-prototype.py
and it looks to be pretty robust. Dependencies are ~requests~ and its
dependencies but otherwise nothing else; will continue to refine it

* Session Transcripts
Extracted using Firefox Dev Tools during reconnaissance on the
protocol used by gradescope
